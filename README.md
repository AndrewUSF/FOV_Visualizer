# FOV Visualizer

Explore how different fields of view feel on screen. Move the sliders to change the horizontal, vertical, or diagonal field of view and see the result instantly.

## What you can do

- Choose a control mode (set any two: Horizontal + Vertical, Horizontal + Diagonal, or Vertical + Diagonal) and the app fills in the third automatically
- Use easy sliders and number boxes for fine adjustments
- Pick common screen shapes (16:9, 4:3, 1:1, 21:9) or enter your own
- Change the overall scale to make the view bigger or smaller
- Toggle visual helpers: grid, simple room backdrop, diagonal lines, and dimming outside the view
